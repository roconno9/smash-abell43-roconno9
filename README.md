## 1. Application Description
This code is meant to be ran for people attempting to select a counterpick stage within a competitive set of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch. As there are over 80+ characters, it can sometimes be difficult to know which stages are best for every match-up in the game. This program is meant to streamline the counterpicking process by allowing the player to input their character and their opponent's character to then inform them of what their most likely best stages are in the match up. This is an important task for competitive players as the stage counterpick or knowing what stages they do/don't want to play on can be the difference of a win or loss in big tournaments. 

## 2. Program Functioning
Two windows will open up. The first will be labeled for your character, and the second with your opponent's character. Select the buttons for each window that correspond to the correct character. An output of the best stages in listed order will be given to user. If they change characters, you can simply update your selection.
